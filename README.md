# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

Analysis of ride sharing app data to show trends in ride data spanning over three different city types; urban suburban and rural.

## Results

* Summary of results for data based on urban, suburban and rural city types

* Line chart displaying total fare by city type between the dates of 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-29

* These results indicate that there are far more total rides, drivers and fares genterated in urban city types than any other city type. 
* Results also indicate that average ride fare is higher in suburban and rural city types compared to urban cities.
* Average fare per driver is seen as having the highest difference between city type, with rural cities having the greatest fares per driver.

## Summary

Following my analysis of the PyBer ride sharing app data, there is disparities that need to be addressed in suburban and rual city types. One reccomondation I could make is to incentivize the option of being a driver, as the data suggest there are more total rides than total drivers in suburban and rural city types. Another suggesstion would be to advertise more in rural and suburban city types, so that rates of total rides and total drivers increase; ultimatley leading to more fares. A final suggestion I can make is to increase fares in urban city types to compensate for the lack of production in other city types.
